                    <p className="p1">The Siberian Husky is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.</p>
                    <p>Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people as well as the Koryak, Yukaghir and Kamchadal people of Siberia for sled pulling and companionship.
                        It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain.
                        Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <h3>Coat</h3>
                    <p>A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds.It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs.It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low 
                        as −50 to −60 °C (−58 to −76 °F). The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming.An excessively long coat, sometimes referred to as a "wooly" or "woolie" 
                        coat, is considered a fault by the breed's standard as it lacks the thicker protection of the standard coat's guard hairs, obscures the dog's clear-cut outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and encrusted with snow and ice.</p>
                    <h3>Eyes</h3>
                    <img src="/images/husky4.jpg" className="husky2"/>
                    <p>The American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky's eyes as "an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely". The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue or black; one of each or particoloured are acceptable (complete is heterochromia). These eye-color combinations are considered acceptable by the American Kennel Club. The parti-color does not affect the vision of the dog.</p>
                    <h3>Nose</h3>
                    <p>Show-quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. In some instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is called "snow nose" or "winter nose". This condition is called hypopigmentation in animals. "Snow nose" is acceptable in the show ring.</p>
                <h3>Tail</h3>
                 <p>Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. When curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the "Siberian Swirl". The AKC recommends the tail should be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a "sickle" shape when excited or interested in something.</p>
                    
                    <img src="/images/husky2.jpg" className="husky3"/>
                   <h3>Size</h3>
                    <p>The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between 20 and 24 inches (51 and 61 cm) 
                        tall at the withers and weighing between 45 and 60 pounds (20 and 27 kg).Females are smaller, growing to between 19 and 23 inches (48 and 58 cm) tall at the withers and weighing between 35 and 50 pounds (16 and 23 kg).The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies as "Siberian Rats" due to their size of 40–50 lb (18–23 kg), versus the Alaskan Malamute's size of 75–85 lb (34–39 kg).</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>The Husky usually howls instead of barking.They have been described as escape artists, which can include digging under, chewing through, or even jumping over fences</p>
                <p>The ASPCA classifies the breed as good with children. It also states they exhibit high energy indoors, have special exercise needs, and may be destructive "without proper care".</p>
               <p>A 6 ft (1.83 m) fence is recommended for this breed as a pet, although some have been known to overcome fences as high as 8 ft (2.44 m).Electric pet fencing may not be effective.
                 They need the frequent companionship of people and other dogs, and their need to feel as part of a pack is very strong.</p>
               <p>The character of the Siberian Husky is friendly and gentle.A study found an association with a gene in the breed and impulsivity, inattention, and high activity.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h3><li>Prehistoric (prior to 1890s)</li></h3>
                    <p>The Chukotka Sled Dog is considered the progenitor to the Siberian Husky. Developed by the Chukchi people of Russia, Chukotka sled dog teams have been used since prehistoric times to pulls sleds in harsh conditions, such as hunting sea mammals on oceanic pack ice</p>
                    <h3><li>Origination of Name and Split from Chukotka Sled Dogs (1890s–1930s)</li></h3>
                    <p>From the 1890s to the 1930s, sled dogs from northeast Siberia and especially Chukotka sled dogs were actively imported in vast numbers to Alaska, to transport gold miners to the Yukon, first as part of the Klondike Gold Rush,then later the "All-Alaska Sweepstakes",
                        a 408-mile (657-km) distance dog sled race from Nome, to Candle, and back. At this time, "Esquimaux" or "Eskimo" was a common pejorative term for native Arctic inhabitants with many dialectal permutations including Uskee, Uskimay and Huskemaw. Thus dogs used by Arctic people were the dogs of the Huskies, the Huskie's dogs, and eventually simply the husky dogs.
                        Canadian and American settlers, not well versed on Russian geography, would distinguish the Chukotka imports by referring to them as Siberian huskies as Chukotka is part of Siberia.</p>
                    <img src="/images/husky6.jpg" className="husky5"/>
                    <p>Smaller, faster and more enduring than the 100- to 120-pound (45- to 54-kg) freighting dogs then in general use, they immediately dominated the Sweepstakes race. Leonhard Seppala, the foremost breeder of Siberian sled dogs of the time, participated in competitions from 1909 to the mid-1920s with a number of championships to his name.</p>
                    
                    <p>On February 3, 1925, Gunnar Kaasen was the final musher in the 1925 serum run to Nome to deliver diphtheria serum from Nenana, over 600 miles to Nome. This was a group effort by several sled dog teams and mushers, with the longest (264 miles or 422 km) and most dangerous segment of the run covered by Leonhard Seppala and his sled team lead dog Togo.
                         The event is depicted in the 2019 film Togo. A measure of this is also depicted in the 1995 animated film Balto; the name of Gunnar Kaasen's lead dog in his sled team was Balto, although unlike the real dog, Balto the character was portrayed as a wolf-dog in the film. In honor of this lead dog, a bronze statue was erected at Central Park in New York City</p>

                    <p>As the breed was beginning to come to prominence, in 1933 Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd brought about 50 Siberian Huskies with him on an expedition in which he hoped to journey around the 16,000-mile coast of Antarctica. Many of the dogs were bred and trained at Chinook Kennels in New Hampshire, owned by Eva Seeley. Called Operation Highjump, the historic trek proved the worth of the Siberian Husky due to its compact size and great speed.[46] Siberian Huskies also served in the United States Army's Arctic Search and Rescue Unit of the Air Transport Command during World War II.
                         Their popularity was sustained into the 21st century. They were ranked 16th among American Kennel Club registrants in 2012,rising to 14th place in 2013.</p>

                    <h2>In culture</h2>
                    <li>A bronze statue of Balto that has been displayed in New York City's Central Park since 1925 is one of the park's enduringly popular features.</li>
                   <li>The Twilight Saga, which features werewolves and the television series Game of Thrones spurred a huge uptick in demand for Siberian Huskies as pets, followed by a steep increase of their numbers at public shelters. Even though the animal actors were not Siberian Huskies, people were acquiring Siberian Huskies because they looked similar to the fictional direwolf characters depicted in the show.[69] Two of the show's stars pleaded with the public to stop acquiring the dogs without first researching the breed</li>
                   <li>The phrase three dog night, meaning it is so cold you would need three dogs in bed with you to keep warm, originated with the Chukchi people of Siberia, who kept the Siberian husky landrace dog that became the modern purebred breed called the Siberian Husky.</li>
                   <li>The World War II Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 was called "Operation Husky".</li>
                   <li>Several purebred Siberian Huskies portrayed Diefenbaker, the "half-wolf" companion to RCMP Constable Benton Fraser, in the CBS/Alliance Atlantis TV series Due South.</li>
