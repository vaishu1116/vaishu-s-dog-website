                <p className="p1">The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. 
                    It is a working dog, and registration is subject to successful completion of a working trial.It is commonly kept as a companion dog and is among the most frequently
                     registered breeds in several Western countries; some may compete in dog shows or obedience trials, or work as guide dogs.</p>
                <p>The Golden Retriever was bred by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated
                     Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever
                     and Bloodhound. It was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.</p>

             <h2>History</h2>
             <p>The Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other British dog breeds.
                 Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the breed.</p>
             <img src="/images/golden7.jpg" className="goldpic4"/>
             <p>In the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan.He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous; Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter.
                Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents.It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever.
                 One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy.The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.</p>
            <p>In 1952 Marjoribanks's great-nephew, Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester, teamed up with Elma Stonex and together they studied Marjoribanks's stud book.In 1960 their research was published, presenting all of the evidence required to counter all tales of Russian ancestry.
                The stud book, which covers the period from 1868 to 1890, is preserved in the library of the Kennel Club in London. In the early days Golden Retrievers were called the 'Flat-coated Retriever, Golden',Initially the Golden Retriever was considered a colour variety of the former breed.
                 In 1903 the Kennel Club recorded the first examples, listing them in the same register as Flat-coats.In 1904 a Golden Retriever won a field trial and in 1908 the first examples were exhibited at conformation shows.In 1911 a breed club was formed for the breed in England, the Golden Retriever Club,
                  and they were given a new name, the 'Yellow or Golden Retriever'; from this point they were increasingly seen as a separate breed from the Flat-coated Retriever.
                It was not until 1913 that the Kennel Club began recording them on a separate breed register from the Flat-coated Retriever and in 1920 the 'Yellow or' was dropped from the breed name and they were officially called the 'Golden Retriever'.</p>

                <h2>Health</h2>
                <p>A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.2 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 10 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.
                    A 2005 Swedish study found that 22% of Golden Retrievers died by the age of 10, less than the overall rate of 35% of dogs dying by the age of 10.</p>
                <p>The breed is unusually prone to cancer, with one United States study finding cancer to be the cause of death in approximately 50% of the population, the second highest in the study. Several European studies found a much lower prevalence (20–39%), which may reflect the significant genetic divergence between the American and European populations.
                     They are especially prone to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the former and one in eight for the latter. The high prevalence of cancer deaths among Golden Retrievers may partly represent a lack of other congenital diseases.
                    One UK study found the risk of metastatic neoplasia in the breed to be 4.86 times higher than other dogs.</p>
