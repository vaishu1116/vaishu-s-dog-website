                    <p className="p1">The Shiba Inu is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest
                         of the six original dog breeds native to Japan.The Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting.Its name literally translates to "brushwood dog", as it is used to flush game.</p>
                    <p>The Shiba Inu is a small, alert, and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails.Its appearance is similar to other Japanese dog breeds such as the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is
                         a different breed with a distinct bloodline, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.</p>
                    <h2>Appearance</h2>
                    <img src="/images/shiba9.jpg" className="shiba7"/>

                    <p>The breed's standard colors are red, sesame, black sesame, red sesame, black and tan, or cream. All have a cream to white ventral color, known as urajiro . Urajiro literally translates to "underside white".
                        The urajiro is required in the following areas on all coat colors: on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, inside the ears, on the underjaw and upper throat inside of legs, 
                        on the abdomen, around the vent and the ventral side of the tail. On reds: commonly on the throat, fore chest, and chest. On blacks and sesames: commonly as a triangular mark on both sides of the fore chest.</p>
                    <h2>Temprament</h2>
                    <p>The Shiba Inu is considered an alert, affectionate, and independent breed with high intelligence but also somewhat stubborn and strong-willed.
                        The terms "spirited boldness", "good nature", and "artlessness" have subtle interpretations that have been the subject of much commentary.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Shiba Inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.Dogs with a similar appearance to the Shiba Inu were represented in dogū made during the prehistoric Jōmon period of Japanese history.</p>
           <p>The Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, such as birds and rabbits. Shiba lived in the mountainous areas of the Chūbu region. During the Meiji Restoration, western dog breeds were imported and crosses between these and native Japanese breeds became popular. From 1912 to 1926, almost no pure Shiba remained. From around 1928, hunters and intellectuals began to show interest in the protection of the remaining pure Shiba</p>
           <img src="/images/shiba7.jpeg" className="shiba3"/>
            <p>Despite efforts to preserve the breed, the Shiba nearly became extinct during World War II due to wartime food shortage, as well as outbreaks of distemper in the 1950s and 60s and the Great Tottori Fire [jp], which discouraged preservation efforts.
                All subsequent dogs were bred from the only three surviving bloodlines.These bloodlines were the Shinshu Shiba from Nagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from the former Mino Province in the south of present-day Gifu Prefecture, and the San'in Shiba from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures.</p>
           <p>The Shinshu Shibas possessed a solid undercoat, with a dense layer of guard hairs, and were small and red in color. The Mino Shibas tended to have thick, prick ears, and possessed a sickle tail, rather than the common curled tail found on most modern Shibas. The San'in Shibas were larger than most modern shibas, and tended to be black, without the common tan and white accents found on modern black-and-tan shibas</p>

            <h2>Health</h2>
            <p>A study in Japan on patella luxation in small breeds found the Shiba Inu to have the second highest rate of the condition, with 35% of the Shiba Inus surveyed being affected.Three genes belonging to the breed were associated with glaucoma were found in an analysis of DNA sequencing.Another study from Japan reviewing cases of dogs presented for ophthalmologic examination found the Shiba Inu to make up 33% of all glaucoma cases whilst only making up 2.7% of the total population used in the study.
                Pyometra, a uterine infection of intact bitches, is slightly more common in the Shiba Inu.The Shiba Inu is predisposed to canine atopic dermatitis.An auto-immune disease common in Akitas Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome is known to occur in the Shiba Inu.</p>

                <h2>Lifespan</h2>
             <p>A review of cemetery data in Japan found that the Shiba Inu had a life expectancy of 15.5 years,
                greater than any other breed. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 14.6 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.</p>
