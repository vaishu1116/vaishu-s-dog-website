                <p className="p1">The German Shepherd, also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.</p>
                <p>It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération 
                    Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013</p>

             <h2>History</h2>
             <p>During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.
                In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen sense of smell.The results were 
                dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another</p>
            <p>To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.
                 The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;
                 some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.
                While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.</p>
            <p>With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.
                 Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.</p>

                <p>In 1899, von Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.Hektor was the product of a few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, 
                    that he purchased him immediately.After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von Stephanitz founded the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.
                    In just a few decades of the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein für Deutsche Schäferhunde claimed 50,000 dues-paying members in more than 500 branches in Germany alone.</p>
                <p>Horand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and Württemberg.Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben. Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's 
                    offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84 pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups 
                    that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog</p>

                <h2 className="name">Naming</h2>
                <p>The breed was named Deutscher Schäferhund, by von Stephanitz, translating to "German Shepherd Dog".At the time, 
                    all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as Altdeutsche Schäferhunde, or old German herding dogs.</p>

                <h2>Modern breed</h2>
                <p>The modern German Shepherd breed is criticised by experts for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that
                     breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability</p>
                <h2>Controversy</h2>
                <p>The Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.</p>
                <p>The issue was raised in the BBC documentary, Pedigree Dogs Exposed, which said that critics of the breed describe it as "half dog, half frog". An orthopaedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were "not normal".</p>
